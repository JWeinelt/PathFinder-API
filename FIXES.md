# PathFinder-API Fixes for runClient Task

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Import in CustomListPlayers.java
**Problem**: The file was importing `scala.actors.threadpool.Arrays` instead of `java.util.Arrays`.
**Impact**: This would cause a `ClassNotFoundException` at runtime when the mod tries to load.
**Fix**: Changed import to `java.util.Arrays` and simplified the `Arrays.asList()` call.

### 2. Incorrect Resource Handling in CommandParser.java
**Problem**: Using `new File(path.getResourcePath()).exists()` to check for mod resources.
**Impact**: This doesn't work for resources inside JAR files (which mods are), causing incorrect resource loading.
**Fix**: Removed the file existence check and let the resource manager handle resource loading properly.

### 3. Repository Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Old Maven repository URLs that are no longer accessible.
**Impact**: Gradle cannot download ForgeGradle dependencies.
**Fix**: Updated repository configuration with modern URLs and specific version pinning.

### 4. Gradle Configuration Improvements
**Problem**: Missing Java home configuration and insufficient JVM options.
**Impact**: Gradle daemon fails to start with newer Java versions.
**Fix**: Added explicit Java 8 path and improved JVM arguments.

## Changes Made

1. **CustomListPlayers.java**: Fixed import and Arrays.asList usage
2. **CommandParser.java**: Improved resource loading logic and removed unused imports
3. **build.gradle**: Updated repository URLs and ForgeGradle version
4. **gradle.properties**: Added Java home configuration and improved JVM settings

## Expected Result

These fixes should resolve the main issues that prevent the `runClient` task from successfully starting Minecraft with the PathFinder-API mod loaded.
