# PathFinder-API Fixes for runClient Task

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Import in CustomListPlayers.java
**Problem**: The file was importing `scala.actors.threadpool.Arrays` instead of `java.util.Arrays`.
**Impact**: This would cause a `ClassNotFoundException` at runtime when the mod tries to load.
**Fix**: Changed import to `java.util.Arrays` and simplified the `Arrays.asList()` call.

**Before:**
```java
import scala.actors.threadpool.Arrays;
...
players.addAll(Arrays.asList(new String[]{"@s", "@a", "@p", "@r", "@e"}));
```

**After:**
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
...
players.addAll(Arrays.asList("@s", "@a", "@p", "@r", "@e"));
```

### 2. Incorrect Resource Handling in CommandParser.java
**Problem**: Using `new File(path.getResourcePath()).exists()` to check for mod resources.
**Impact**: This doesn't work for resources inside JAR files (which mods are), causing incorrect resource loading.
**Fix**: Removed the file existence check and let the resource manager handle resource loading properly.

**Before:**
```java
if (new File(path.getResourcePath()).exists()) {
    IResource resource = rm.getResource(path);
    // ... process resource
}
```

**After:**
```java
// Check if the resource exists using the resource manager instead of file system
IResource resource = rm.getResource(path);
// ... process resource (exception handling covers non-existent resources)
```

### 3. Repository Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Old Maven repository URLs that are no longer accessible.
**Impact**: Gradle cannot download ForgeGradle dependencies.
**Fix**: Updated repository configuration with modern URLs and specific version pinning.

### 4. Gradle Configuration Improvements
**Problem**: Missing Java home configuration and insufficient JVM options.
**Impact**: Gradle daemon fails to start with newer Java versions.
**Fix**: Added explicit Java 8 path and improved JVM arguments.

## Changes Made

1. **CustomListPlayers.java**: Fixed import and Arrays.asList usage
2. **CommandParser.java**: Improved resource loading logic and removed unused imports
3. **build.gradle**: Updated repository URLs and ForgeGradle version
4. **gradle.properties**: Added Java home configuration and improved JVM settings

## Expected Result

These fixes should resolve the main issues that prevent the `runClient` task from successfully starting Minecraft with the PathFinder-API mod loaded.

## Testing Notes

Due to network restrictions in the current environment, the full `runClient` task cannot be tested. However, the critical code issues that would cause runtime failures have been identified and fixed:

1. The scala import issue would have caused immediate ClassNotFoundException
2. The resource handling issue would have caused problems when loading pathfinder.json files from mods
3. The repository configuration prevents ForgeGradle from being downloaded

The fixes address these fundamental issues that would prevent Minecraft from starting successfully.
